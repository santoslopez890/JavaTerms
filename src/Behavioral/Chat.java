    //S
    // During my time at Emr It was everyone's job to handle material in some way

    //from clients or when a certain material pile would need to be pushed by the loader
    //Co workers would also communicate with me if they needed help with a spanish speaking customer
    // as I was the only one that was able to speak spanish
    //so that I am available to help purchase and inspect material and to be notified of incoming
    //loads that might require special attention

    // and cooperation

    // Halfway through the project

    //A After talking with our group member and actively trying to help them with their part
    // they still would not put in the work to do their part
