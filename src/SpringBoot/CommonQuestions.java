//
     //Spring Boot basic concepts
    //
    //• What is Spring Boot?
    //Spring Boot is an open-source Java framework that helps developers build web applications, micro services, and standalone Spring projects
    //
    //• What are the main features of Spring Boot?
    //Auto-configuration, Embedded Servers, Spring Initializr, Actuator, Externalized Configuration, Spring Boot CLI, Micro Service support, Simple Dependency management
    //
    //• What is the difference between Spring and Spring Boot?
    //Spring is a lightweight framework that provides a programming and configuration model for Java applications. Spring Boot is an extension of Spring that speeds up the development process by simplifying configuration and providing pre-configured options.
    //
    //• What are the advantages of using Spring Boot?
    //reduced development time due to auto-configuration, minimal boilerplate code, embedded servers like Tomcat and Jetty, no need for XML configuration, easier application deployment
    //
    //• How does Spring Boot simplify Java development?
    //1. Auto-configuration:
    //2. Embedded Servers: Spring Boot applications can be packaged as self-contained JAR files, which include an embedded web server (Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow). This means you don't need to deploy your application to an external server, making deployment much simpler.
    //3. Production-Ready Features: Spring Boot provides several production-ready features, such as:
    //Actuator: Provides endpoints for monitoring and managing your application.
    //Spring Security: Simplifies the implementation of security features in your application.
    //Spring Data: Simplifies data access for relational and NoSQL databases.
//            ### Configuration and Setup
//6. **How do you set up a Spring Boot application?**
//            7. **What is the purpose of the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file?**
//            8. **How can you externalize configuration in Spring Boot?**
//            9. **What is the difference between `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Controller`?**
//            10. **What is the use of `@SpringBootApplication` annotation?**

//11. **What is Spring Boot Starter?**
//            12. **How do you add custom dependencies in a Spring Boot project?**
//            13. **Explain the concept of auto-configuration in Spring Boot.**
//
//            ### Application Development
//14. **How do you create a RESTful web service using Spring Boot?**
//            15. **What is the difference between `@RestController` and `@Controller`?**
//            16. **How do you handle exceptions in Spring Boot?**
//            17. **What is the use of `@RequestMapping` and `@GetMapping`?**
//
//            ### Security
//18. **How do you implement security in a Spring Boot application?**
//            19. **What is Spring Security, and how is it integrated with Spring Boot?**
//            20. **How can you implement JWT authentication in Spring Boot?**
//
//            ### Data Access
//21. **How do you connect a Spring Boot application to a database?**
//            22. **What is Spring Data JPA, and how does it simplify data access?**
//            23. **How do you handle transactions in Spring Boot?**
//
//            ### Testing
//24. **How do you write unit tests for a Spring Boot application?**
//            25. **What is the purpose of the `@SpringBootTest` annotation?**
//            26. **How do you test RESTful services in Spring Boot?**
