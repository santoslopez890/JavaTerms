package DataStructures;
//In Java, a HashMap is a data structure that implements the Map interface,
// allowing you to store key-value pairs. It provides efficient retrieval of
// values based on their associated keys.
//Key points about HashMaps:
//Implementation:
//Internally, HashMap uses a hash table to store the data.
// This allows for fast access to elements using the keys.
//Key-Value Pairs:
//Each entry in the HashMap consists of a unique key and its corresponding value.
//No Duplicates:
//Keys must be unique within a HashMap. If you try to insert
// a key that already exists, the old value will be replaced with the new one.
//Unordered:
//The order of elements in a HashMap is not guaranteed.
//Time Complexity:
//On average, the operations like get() and put() have a time complexity of O(1), which makes them very efficient for large datasets.
